#Boris Bikes 
London's Boris Bikes (well, 'Santander Cycles') are awesome. For a small fee, anyone can hire out a bike and ride it around London. Bikes are located at Docking Stations dotted throughout the city.

###Challenge 1:
    Set up a simple project
    Explain why a complete README is important
    Intialize and push a git project

###Challenge 2: 
    Give the structure of a User Story
    Extract a Domain Model from User Stories

	Bike <-- working? --> true/false
	DockingStation <-- release_bike --> a Bike

###Challenge 3: 
    Define 'Feature Test'
    Define 'stack trace'
    Use irb to run a 'feature test'

        2.2.2 :001 > station = DockingStation.new
	     NameError: uninitialized constant DockingStation
            from (irb):1
	    from /usr/share/rvm/rubies/ruby-2.2.2/bin/irb:11:in `<main>'

###Challenge 4: 
    Explain how to use a stack trace to debug errors
    Debug an error using a stack trace
        NameError: uninitialized constant DockingStation

###Challenge 5: 
    Define RSpec as a testing framework
    Create a spec file
    Describe and Object using a specification
    Set up a Unit Test

###Challenge 6: 
    Pass a unit test
    Use require

###Challenge 7:
    Move between Feature and Unit Tests


###Challenge 8: 
    Write an RSpec test using it
    Test that an Object responds to a Message

###Challenge 9:    
    Practice Learning Objectives from Challenges 3 â€“ 8

###Challenge 10:
    Use Objects within other Objects
    Use RSpec 'predicate' syntax
    Pass a feature test     

###Challenge 11:
    Write RSpec tests that require arguments
    Pass an instance as an argument
    Set an attribute on an instantiated Object using an @ instance variable
    Use attr_reader to read an attribute on an instantiated Object 

###Challenge 12:
    Write RSpec tests that expect errors
    Use fail or raise to raise an error
    Use a 'guard condition'   

###Challenge 13:
    Write RSpec tests that expect errors
    Use fail or raise to raise an error
    Use a 'guard condition 

###Challenge 14:
    Set a complex attribute on an instantiated Object
    Set an initial attribute value using initialize          

###Challenge 15:
    Use the Single Responsibility Principle
    Refactor code for readability

###Challenge 16:
    Use a constant

###Challenge 17
    Set an initial attribute value using initialize
    Set a default initialization value
